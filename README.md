# PasswordGenerator
### Challenge: Create a simple application that generates a password of a length specified by user input.

**Mandatory Parameters:**
1) Must contain an uppercase character
2) Must contain a lowercase character
3) Must contain a minimum of one integer between 0-9
4) Must contain a special character from the following: `!£$%^&*();:@~#<>,?`
5) The length must be validated as an integer no less than eight (so the password must be at least eight characters)

**Optional Parameters:**
1) Implement functionality so that no characters in the password can be repeated consecutively: `@#/j99` is invalid, but `@#/j9h9` isn't.
